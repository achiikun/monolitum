# monolitum
The non-reactive PHP framework.

The purpose of this framework is to bring Facebook's React application building philosophy to PHP, as well as having the least dependencies possible and being executable on the cheapest low-cost Apache-PHP-MySQL stack server out there.

Minimum PHP version: **5.6**

No documentation is written by now. The framework is in development.

## Modules

The main module of the framework is called ´monolitum´. The code is inside submodules (nested packages).

The file [notes.md](notes.md) contains the dependencies between themselves.
